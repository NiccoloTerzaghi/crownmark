Usage: crownmark [--help|-h]

Options:
  --help, -h          Show this help message and exit.

How it works:
  - Recursively scans your project directory from the current location.
  - Adds a header comment at the top of each supported source file,
    showing the relative path from the project root.
  - If a file already has the correct header, it is skipped.
  - If a file has an outdated header (for example, after renaming or moving),
    it is updated to reflect the correct path.

Supported file types:
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX
  - Python, Shell, Ruby, Go, Java, Kotlin, C, C++, C#, PHP, Dart
  - CSS, SCSS, LESS
  - HTML, XML, Markdown
  - YAML (.yml, .yaml)

Examples:
  crownmark
    Scans the project and adds or updates headers in place.
